# Comeback to Coding

Welcome to my coding journey! This repository documents my **return to programming** and tracks the projects, exercises, and experiments Iâ€™m working on.

## Goals

1. Strengthen fundamental programming skills.
2. Learn and apply Git version control efficiently.
3. Build small projects to reinforce learning.
4. Keep a log of my coding journey.
